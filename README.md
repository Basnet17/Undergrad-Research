Waterman.cpp: This is the file which uses smith waterman algorithm. This version of smith waterman algorithm is done using dynamic memory allocation.
  As there will be millions of strings to be read from the genomic data, the memory of a computer may not always be sufficient
  therefore with the usage of the dynamic memory allocation we can achieve the memory overflow.
  
LTR.cpp: Finds out the presence of Long Terminal Repeats in the mosquito genomes.
Convert.cpp: Converts the fastq file format into the fasta file format.
